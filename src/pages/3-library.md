QEDA Library
============

One of the killer features of QEDA project is the open, free and constantly growing library of electronic components. Under the hood it is just a git repository with many YAML-descriptions grouped by manufacturer company name.

**GitHub**: <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/qeda/library" target="_blank">https://github.com/qeda/library</a><!--_-->

Please refer to [Component description](/doc/qeda/component/) section in order to learn how to add new electronic component.

If you created new element description that looks and works good, feel free to send <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/qeda/library/pulls" target="_blank"><!--_-->pull request</a> in order to add it to master branch.

Request for new elements
------------------------

If you do not feel to be quite experienced to create needed element you may open <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/qeda/library/issues" target="_blank"><!--_-->an issue</a> with request. These requests are not guaranteed to be implemented quickly but tend to.
