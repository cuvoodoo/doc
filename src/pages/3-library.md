QEDA Library
============

One of the killer features of QEDA project is the open, free and constantly growing library of electronic components. Under the hood it is just a git repository with many YAML-descriptions grouped by manufacturer company name.

**GitHub**: [https://github.com/qeda/library](https://github.com/qeda/library)

Please refer to [Component description](/core/component/) section in order to learn how to add new electronic component.

If you created new element description that looks and works good, feel free to send [pull request](https://github.com/qeda/library/pulls) in order to add it to master branch.

Request for new elements
------------------------

If you do not feel to be quite experienced to create needed element you may open [an issue](https://github.com/qeda/library/issues) with request. These requests are not guaranteed to be implemented quickly but tend to.

Anyway do not hesitate to write us to [library@qeda.org](mailto:library@qeda.org) if your project has specific requirements to element library.
