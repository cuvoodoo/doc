<p>One of the killer features of QEDA project is the open, free and constantly growing library of electronic components. Under the hood it is just a git repository with many YAML-descriptions grouped by manufacturer company name.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/qeda/library" target="_blank">https://github.com/qeda/library</a><!--_--></p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="/doc/qeda/component/">Component description</a> section in order to learn how to add new electronic component.</p>
<p>If you created new element description that looks and works good, feel free to send <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/qeda/library/pulls" target="_blank"><!--_-->pull request</a> in order to add it to master branch.</p>
<h2 id="request-for-new-elements">Request for new elements</h2>
<p>If you do not feel to be quite experienced to create needed element you may open <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/qeda/library/issues" target="_blank"><!--_-->an issue</a> with request. These requests are not guaranteed to be implemented quickly but tend to.</p>
